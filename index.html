        <p class="description-text">
            Note: For Events that use our Zoom integration, you must be the Event Creator in order to edit Event Settings. This is because the connected Zoom account is specific to the person who created the Event.
        </p>

        <h4 class="list-heading ">How Zoom Events and Settings Sync Between Wadhwani Entrepreneur and Zoom.us</h4>
        <p class="description-text two">
            When using the Zoom integration in Wadhwani Entrepreneur, all Zoom meetings or webinars that you create in your Wadhwani Entrepreneur will automatically sync to your account on Zoom.us. This means that if you change something in the Zoom Event in your Wadhwani Entrepreneur, it will automatically change on Zoom.us.
