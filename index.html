            Note: For Events that use our Zoom integration, you must be the Event Creator in order to edit Event
            Settings. This is because the connected Zoom account is specific to the person who created the Event.

            When using the Zoom integration in Wadhwani Entrepreneur, all Zoom meetings or webinars that you create in
            your Wadhwani Entrepreneur will automatically sync to your account on Zoom.us. This means that if you change
            something in the Zoom Event in your Wadhwani Entrepreneur, it will automatically change on Zoom.us.
